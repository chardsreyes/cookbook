				<p align="justify">In cooking, a chef's knife, also known as a cook's knife, is a cutting
				tool used in food preparation. The chef's knife was originally designed primarily to slice
				and disjoint large cuts of beef. Today it is the primary general-utility knife for most western cooks.
				</br></br>
				A chef's knife generally has a blade eight inches (20 centimeters) in length and 1 1⁄2 inches
				(3.8 cm) in width, although individual models range from 6 to 14 inches (15 to 36 centimetres)
				in length. There are two common types of blade shape in western chef's knives, French and German. 
				German-style knives are more deeply and continuously curved along the whole cutting edge; the
				French style has an edge that is straighter until the end and then curves up to the tip. Neither
				style is inherently superior; personal preference will dictate the choice.
				</br></br>
				A Japanese chef's knife is known as a gyuto (牛刀 ぎゅうとう） gyūtō?), literally meaning 'beef knife
				Its blade resembles a flatter version of a French chef's knife. Japanese cutlery is known for
				sharpness due to its acute blade geometry, and the hardness of the steel used, sometimes exceeding 
				60 HRC on the Rockwell scale. A typical western chef's knife may be sharpened to an edge angle of 
				20-22°, while a Japanese gyuto generally has a sharper edge angle of 15-18°, which requires a harder,
				more brittle grade of steel. In recent years Japanese gyuto have gained in popularity with western chefs.
				A modern chef's knife is a multi-purpose knife designed to perform well at many differing kitchen 
				tasks, rather than excelling at any one in particular. It can be used for mincing, slicing, and chopping 
				vegetables, slicing meat, and disjointing large cuts.
